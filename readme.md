# Kubernetes Workshop

This workshop deals with the deployment of microservices. Tools such as Docker, Kubernetes and Helm are presented, which should simplify the deployment.

The GitHub repository contains simple Java sample applications that will be deployed in different ways in the hand-on parts of the workshop. Tips and instructions for the tools can be found in this wiki.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/bdruesedow/kubernetes-workshop/wiki) for preparation, Hand-On and Troubleshoot.
